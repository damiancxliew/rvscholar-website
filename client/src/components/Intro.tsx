            <Paragraph style={style}>
                Founded in 1956, <b>River Valley High School (RVHS)</b> is a
                forward-looking educational institution steeped in history and
                eastern culture. Since it was founded more than 67 years ago,
                RVHS has nurtured many generations of Singaporeans that have
                went on to contribute significantly to the nation in various
                areas as leaders of distinction for Singapore.

                In 1979, owing to her strong Chinese roots, RVHS was designated
                as a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School to develop all
                students to be bicultural and effectively bilingual in English
                and Chinese. In 1994, RVHS was selected to be in the pioneer
                batch of six schools to be granted the Autonomous Status (AS).
                In 2006, RVHS was given the green light to run the Integrated
                Programme (IP). These give RVHS its present status as an S.I.A.
                school, where S stands for SAP, I stands for IP and A stands for
                Autonomous.
